# My Firefly-iii Docker Setup

Goal: Have a development and production deployment environments setup
with docker-compose for the [Firefly-iii](https://www.firefly-iii.org/) application. Have the development environment support automatic updates using
[Watchtower](https://containrrr.github.io/watchtower/).

Still work in progress.
